# QGIS GPS Replayer

Allows replay of a previously logged GPS file (i.e. a NMEA text log). The playback is tied to the
QGIS temporal controller, allowing users to play and scrub forward and backward in time through
the logged GPS information.

## Usage

1. Enable the following panels/toolbars:
    - GPS Toolbar
    - Plugins Toolbar
    - Temporal Controller Panel
2. Make sure you are "Disconnected from GPS" in the GPS Toolbar
3. Click "Replay GPS Log" in the Plugins Toolbar and load your file.
4. You should now be "Connected to GPS" in the GPS Toolbar
5. Now press "Animated temporal Navigation" and select the correct step size...
